âœ‹ Hand Gesture Recognition (Python, OpenCV, Mediapipe)
Overview

A real-time hand gesture recognition prototype built with Python, OpenCV, and Mediapipe.
The system detects and tracks hand movements from a webcam feed and classifies basic gestures, enabling experiments in human-computer interaction (HCI).

This project was an opportunity to combine computer vision techniques with practical engineering, focusing on performance and real-time reliability.

Features

ðŸ“· Real-time video capture and processing (~30 FPS).

âœ‹ Hand landmark detection and tracking using Mediapipe.

ðŸ”Ž Basic gesture recognition (e.g., open hand, fist, pointing).

ðŸ›  Modular design â†’ easy to extend with new gestures or custom actions.

Technical Details

- Language: Python 3

- Libraries: OpenCV, Mediapipe, NumPy

Pipeline:

- Capture frames from webcam.

- Detect and extract hand landmarks.

- Classify gestures based on relative landmark positions.

- Performance: Optimised frame processing to maintain ~30 FPS.
